You have prepared four problems. The difficulty levels of the problems are A1,A2,A3,A4 respectively. 
A problem set comprises at least two problems and no two problems in a problem set should have the same difficulty level. 
A problem can belong to at most one problem set. Find the maximum number of problem sets you can create using the four problems.

1≤T≤1000
1≤A1,A2,A3,A4≤10
